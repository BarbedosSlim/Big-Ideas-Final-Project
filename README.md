Neighborhood population: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/40188e1c-6d2e-4f20-9391-607bd3054949/resource/8ac5c768-09ba-43a8-829f-ce4a417d20fb/download/population-density.csv]

Built Environment Conditions: [https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/pgh/resource/61a264ec-a537-42de-91e3-5752d689103d](https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/40188e1c-6d2e-4f20-9391-607bd3054949/resource/61a264ec-a537-42de-91e3-5752d689103d/download/built-enviornment-conditions.csv)
